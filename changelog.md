## [Unreleased]

## [0.22.0] - 2023-12-27
### Added
- Added support for using the action in multiple steps in the same job ([#26](https://github.com/cross-platform-actions/action/issues/26)).
    All the inputs need to be the same for all steps, except for the following
    inputs: `sync_files`, `shutdown_vm` and `run`.

- Added support for specifying that the VM should not shutdown after the action
    has run. This adds a new input parameter: `shutdown_vm`. When set to `false`,
    this will hopefully mitigate very frequent freezing of VM during teardown ([#61](https://github.com/cross-platform-actions/action/issues/61), [#72](https://github.com/cross-platform-actions/action/issues/72)).

### Changed
- Always terminate VM instead of shutting down. This is more efficient and this
    will hopefully mitigate very frequent freezing of VM during teardown
    ([#61](https://github.com/cross-platform-actions/action/issues/61),
    [#72](https://github.com/cross-platform-actions/action/issues/72)).

- Use `unsafe` as the cache mode for QEMU disks. This should improve performance ([#67](https://github.com/cross-platform-actions/action/issues/67)).

## [0.21.1] - 2023-11-03
### Fixed
- FreeBSD jobs occasionally fail when ejecting the disk ([#64](https://github.com/cross-platform-actions/action/issues/64))

## [0.21.0] - 2023-10-26
### Added
- Add support for OpenBSD 7.4 ([openbsd-builder#15](https://github.com/cross-platform-actions/openbsd-builder/issues/15))

## [0.20.0] - 2023-10-24
### Added
- Add support for disabling file syncing ([#65](https://github.com/cross-platform-actions/action/issues/65)).
    This adds a new input parameter, `sync_files`. It allows to specify
    which directions files should be synced. From the runner to the VM,
    from the VM to the runner, both or none.

## [0.19.1] - 2023-10-07
### Fixed
- NetBSD - VM doesn't start ([#62](https://github.com/cross-platform-actions/action/issues/62))

## [0.19.0] - 2023-08-17
### Changed
- VMs running via QEMU only expose SSE and SSE2 CPU features ([#60](https://github.com/cross-platform-actions/action/issues/60)).
    This changes the machine to `q35` and the cpu to `max`, for x86-64 using
    the QEMU hypervisor. This adds more CPU features like AVX and AVX2.

## [0.18.0] - 2023-08-04
### Added
- Add support for custom image URLs ([#13](https://github.com/cross-platform-actions/action/pull/13))
- Add architecture alias for x86-64: x64 ([#58](https://github.com/cross-platform-actions/action/issues/58))

## [0.17.0] - 2023-07-25
### Changed
- Bump QEMU to 8.0.3 ([resources#3](https://github.com/cross-platform-actions/resources/pull/4))

## [0.16.0] - 2023-07-21
### Added
- Add support for FreeBSD ARM64 ([#55](https://github.com/cross-platform-actions/action/issues/55))

## [0.15.0] - 2023-06-12
### Changed

- Support for configuring CPU core count ([#16](https://github.com/cross-platform-actions/action/issues/17))

### Changed
- Use output groups to hide all output except the run command
    (No output is removed, just hidden by default) ([#49](https://github.com/cross-platform-actions/action/issues/49))
- Remove support for IPv6 for NetBSD ([#46](https://github.com/cross-platform-actions/action/issues/46))
- Increased default memory to 13GB on macOS runner and to 6GB on Linux runners ([#16](https://github.com/cross-platform-actions/action/issues/16))
- Increased default CPU core count to 3 on macOS runner and to 2 on Linux runners ([#16](https://github.com/cross-platform-actions/action/issues/17))
- Changed from two CPU sockets to one CPU socket ([#16](https://github.com/cross-platform-actions/action/issues/17))

### Fixed
- NetBSD - very slow network ([#46](https://github.com/cross-platform-actions/action/issues/46))
